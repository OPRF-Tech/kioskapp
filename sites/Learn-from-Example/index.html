<!doctype html> <!-- First, this doctype declaration is the latest version, use it because you should... -->
<!-- second, anything inside the !-- and -- tags is a comment, so this text doesn't appear on the page -->

<html> <!-- starts your html page, seems redundant, but you need it, it's a markup language after all -->

<head> <!-- anything in the head is meta data, and not visible on the page, but it can effect the page -->
	<title>Learn From Example</title> 
		<!-- anything inside of a <> set is called a tag. The title tag (the one on the line above)
			 is the text that appears in your browser's tab/title area (so on the top of the browser's
			 viewing area, it says "Learn From Example".
			 
			 Good formatting is also important in html, simply so you can read it yourself when you come back
			 to the page. Good formatting is generally tabbing in everything inside a tag (when you have tags 
			 inside of tags it's called nesting), This comment is only tabbed so all the text lines up, and so
			 it's differentiated.

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />
		<!-- The link tag is a speicial kind of tag (not because it has other stuff other than link in it, but
			 give me a second to get to that), it's a self-closing tag, which means that instead of having a
			 matching </tag> after the opening tag (<tag>) it opens and closes all in one.
			 
			 The strings following the initial tag name are called attributes, the link tag has other attributes
			 besides those, but those are the important ones.
			 
			 The link tag tells the browser that you're going to literally link a file to this file. The rel 
			 attribute tells the browser what this link is going to be (or the what relationship the linked
			 file has to this file, in this case it's a stylesheet, or a declaration of how the page should look), the type
			 attribute tells the browser how to interpret that file (or what kind of file you're using, a css
			 file is always text/css), and the href attribute is where the linked file is located (either 
			 relative or direct.
			 
			 A relative url is one that is kept relative to the current document, it doesn't include a / or http://
			 before the url. For example, if you were linking to a second page in the same directory as this one,
			 it would be page2.html, where if you were linking to a page on another site it would be 
			 http://othersite.tld/page2.html. a / before the url says the file is in the root directory of the site,
			 and a ../ tells it to go up one folder (so if your file is in the /one/ directory, and you want to link
			 to file /two/file.html, the url is either /two/file.html or ../two/file.html (both are relative)

			Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then observed by Ahab had unaccountably 
			escaped every one else; but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause. Thrusting his 
			head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly

				 I manually formatted my paragraph to have multiple lines for easier reading, you don't have to, but
				 it's suggested. HTML DOES NOT READ WHITESPACE, but humans do...
				 
				 The p tag stands for paragraph, it is you basic text form.
				 
				 At the end of my paragraph, I included &pound; I could have included a number of others, but this
				 is juat an example. In html, to use special characters in text (like the pound symbol, or ampersand),
				 you need to use an & followed by the specific code for your character, followed by a semicolon.
				 
				 The common ones are:
				 	&amp;	- &
				 	&nbsp;	- " " (a space, technically a nonbreaking space)
				 	&lt;	- < - the only way to show a < in text
				 	&gt;	- > - the only way to show a > in text
				 	&copy;	- copyright symbol
				 	&quot;	- " - a quotation mark - you can also use &ldquo; for an opening quotation mark 
				 				  and &rdquo; for a closing (ldquo - left double quote) (rdquo - right double quote)
				 	&apos;	= ' = an apostrophy - you can also use &lsquo; for an opening one and &rsquo; for a closing
				 				  one. (lsquo - left single quote) (rsquo - right single quote)
