<h2>Taking Your Eclipse Projects Home</h2>

<h3>At School: </h3>

<ul class="supplies">
	<li>File --> Export</li>
	<li>General --> Archive File</li>
	<li>Select All (or just the projects you want)</li>
	<li>To Archive File: Click Browse</li>
	<li>Select your USB Flash Drive or your U: drive, and make up a name.  (If you use the U: drive you will have to email the archive to yourself, or logon from home and download it.)</li>
	<li>Click Finish - let it write the stuff to your flash drive (or U: drive)</li>
	<li>Replace the old file if it's already there</li>
</ul>

<h3>At Home: </h3>
<ul class="supplies">
	<li>If the projects you want are already in your workspace at home, delete them first.</li>
	<li>File --> Import</li>
	<li>General --> Exiting Projects into Workspace</li>
	<li>Select archive file --> Browse to the file you saved on your flash drive (or from email or school download).  It ends in .zip</li>
	<li>Select the projects you want to import - if they're already in the workspace, this won't work - they need to be deleted first.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bringing Your Eclipse Projects Back to School</h3>
<p>Just reverse the above process</p>
<ul class="supplies">
<li>Export at home</li>
<li>Import at school</li>
</ul>
