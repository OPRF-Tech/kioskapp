<h3>Computer Programming at OPRFHS</h3>
<p>
After several years of declining enrollment and the eventual discontinuance of computer programming 
courses after the dot-com collapse, the program was revived in 2005. A former software engineer 
from the B2B eCommerce space, new to teaching, was hired to design and teach the curriculum. 
The programming classes started with 16 students in 2005 and have grown four-fold to over 60 
students in 2009-2010.</p>

<p>
The main language used in the programming courses is Java. An object-oriented approach to programming
is taught early and consistently throughout the courses. Students engage in Rapid Application 
Development techniques by working in small groups to solve problems.

Many of these students take the Advanced Placement test in computer science administered by The 
College Board. OPRF students are demonstrating significant achievement and college readiness as 
is illustrated in these summarized results:
