			<div class="col1 text">
				<p>This is my seventh day of linux as my primary operating system.</p> 
				
				<p>So far, so good. My notable problems have all been solved (last night 
				too, I upgraded from 32bit Ubuntu to 64bit, now everything is almost 
				exactly the same on both my laptop and my desktop.</p> 
				
				<p>So, let&#8217;s start with what I&#8217;ve got now compared to the initial 
				&#8220;Praxis&#8217; Software&#8221;
				list:</p> 
				
				<ul> 
					<li>Rhythmbox be gone! Having, last night, upgraded to 64bit, everything 
					is now all peachy between Praxis and Banshee.</li> 
					
					<li>I like Gwibber. I like it more than #newtwitter, and it comes preinstalled, bonus.</li> 
					
					<li>I downloaded Filezilla, I forgot to grab an ftp client (oops)</li> 
				</ul> 
				
				<p>As for things I&#8217;ve been feeling like mentioning but haven&#8217;t:</p> 
				
				<ul> 
					<li>I like having a universal menu. Sure it&#8217;s a bit different than what 
					I&#8217;m used to, but it keeps windows less cluttered and gives everything 
					a more unified interface. There are still some apps that don&#8217;t support 
					it (and never will &#8211; chrome), but I&#8217;m okay with that.</li> 
					
					<li>With the universal menu, I&#8217;ve slimmed from the menu bar to the main 
					menu (which is just the ubuntu logo with a drop down). Less space taken up in 
					the upper panel, giving more room to the universal menu. It also fits in better 
					with the universal menu .</li> 
				</ul> 
				
				<p>Also, moving between installs, I&#8217;ve learned that I really like having a 
				script which will do all the setup stuff for me. I only needed to do three things 
				after running my setup script, add in and integrate the universal menu, fix my own 
				menus (I don&#8217;t use the default ones, I&#8217;ve instead divided things up 
				into Internet, Create, Play, Media and Tools. Same for my laptop), and set the icon 
				set to Faenza (I&#8217;m pretty sure I could have done two of the three with my script 
				but didn&#8217;t really want to look into it when I was writing the script)</p> 
				
				<p>Alright, now that that&#8217;s out of the way, I love the terminal. Having used 
				Windows as my primary operating system I never really had to use the command prompt, 
				but when I did it always felt really clunky. That&#8217;s not the case with the 
				terminal. I just can&#8217;t say enough about it, so I&#8217;ll just stop.</p> 
				
				<p>My search for a more Windows 7 like taskbar is still in vain, I&#8217;m still 
				using Docky, but at least it&#8217;s in panel mode.</p>
