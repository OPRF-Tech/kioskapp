				<p>OPRF Tech is the OPRF Technology club.  We’re a fun&dash;loving group that 
				likes to do things with computers. Things we generally do are rebuild computers, 
				design and develop websites, program desktop applications, as well as make and 
				program our own robots.

				<p>We are a ‘double-club’, meaning we’re both the technology 
				club and the robotics club, combined into one.</p>

				<p><em>should i join?</em></p>
				<p>We encourage everyone to join, whether you’re a ‘nerd’ or ‘geek’ like one of us, 
				or someone who prefers to be more socially acceptable.  That’s fine with us. Our 
				members generally fit the following description, but like we said, we’re open to everyone;
				
				<blockquote>We’re self-described geeks, we like to write code for computers. Oh yeah, math 
				problems, those are fun.  If we’re not found using a computer, than we’re generally found 
				fixing one.  We like science-fiction (two of us wrote our Junior Themes on science-fiction)</blockquote>
				If that doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, there are plenty of other clubs out there, 
				but we’d still love to have you visit us.</p>
