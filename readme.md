# Kiosk App

Kiosk App is meant to be a really simple kiosk for displaying information about a product or 
pretty much anything that needs a flexible framework for displaying multiple things using a 
lightbox style display.

## Notes

You shouldn't have to do anything to configure the app itself, however if you want the signup 
section to work, you'll need to configure that inside of the `signup` directory, and to make
the see signups section work, you'll need to configure that through `sites/See-Signups`.

Any circle button along the bottom of the page needs to be included in a directory in the 
`sites` directory. Any space in the name needs to be a dash (`-`), the system does read
capitalizations.

The `sites/OPRF-Tech/` directory can also be found at OPRF-Tech/TechWeb on github.
